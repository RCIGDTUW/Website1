The vagina is the small opening that girls have between their legs. Menstruation is also called a girls/woman’s “period.” Just as some girls begin puberty earlier or later than others, the same applies to periods. Some girls may begin to menstruate as early as age nine or 10, and some may not get their first period until a few years later. Menstruation usually stops in the 40’s and this is known as menopause.

hormone levels change and ovulation does not necessarily occur on a regular basis. So, the interval between periods, the amount of menstrual flow, and the duration of the period are likely to vary considerably from cycle to cycle. Girls may be concerned about differences between their cycle and that of their friends. They may worry if, after their first period, they do not menstruate again for two to three months, but these are normal variations.

Girls need to change their napkins regularly during the period of menstruation especially in the first three days. This can help prevent infections. During the heaviest days of your period, you may need to change them every 3-4 hours. Given below is a pictorial representation of the normal timings to change pads.

This process for some is painful. Some girls get cramps that are more severe than others. Pain relievers, exercise, a hot bath, or a heat compress can help this.Some girls have cramps during their periods. Cramps are actually uterus’ contractions. The uterus, which is like a pear-shaped muscle, helps get rid of the endometrium, or lining of the uterus. These contractions that sometimes feel like cramps are the body’s way of shedding, or getting rid the lining of the uterus, through the vagina, and out of the body, as the lining is no longer needed that cycle.

It is also to be remembered that the garbage such napkins generate, also leads to all problems associated with solid waste management.

Keep dropping ash after use. Once the pit is filled up, close the pit completely and use another pit

It is better to keep a dust bin in the corner of the toilet. Wash the soiled napkins and squeeze dry. Keep old newspapers/waste paper ready to wrap the washed napkin. Drop it in the bin. You can dispose the contents of the bin after your cycle bleed is over or daily. This can be given away as waste to garbage collectors in areas where they come to collect them. In case there is no disposal mechanism prevalent in your locality, see about disposing it within your backyard itself either by sanitary pit or incineration.
